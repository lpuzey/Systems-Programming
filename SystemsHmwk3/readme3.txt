Summary of Program:
This program is used rewrite many of the built in header functions. The functions that we rewrote include strlen(), strcpy,strdup, etc. The other progrm makes a struct of Employees and random Employees. Then there are two functions that duplicate that data.

How to Run this Program:
First you need to open up the file and the terminal. If you put the file in any folder put the command in the terminal: cd foldername. Once you have done that, to run the program put the command: make into the terminal. That will compile the program and to finally run it put in one last command: ./testname. The program will then print all of the test cases for section A and B.

Problems I Had:
1.Implicit declaration: I kept having this issue and it was easily fixed by putting the function prototype into the header file
2. Seg fault: I kept getting seg faults when I was testing the array wrong.
3.Wrong type: I had a bunch of errors where I had a function with the wrong type and this was also easily fixed.
